### The [Shop Log Parser](https://github.com/Price-Index/Shop-Log-Parser) has been updated!
> [!INFO]
> Latest version is now [v1.0.1](https://github.com/Price-Index/Shop-Log-Parser/releases/tag/v1.0.1)!

The Shop Log Parser should now work correctly without any issues and not need any future updates (except for 1 small directory hotfix _soon_, which shouldn't really affect any parsed data.)
